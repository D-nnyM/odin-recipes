        <h3>Tastes like a bowl of sunshine and love!</h3>

        <p>Everyone needs a feel good dish, and for me, this is it. This
            dish tastes delicious and warms you up from the inside out!
            I first tried this is the dead of winter and it literally
            felt like the sun was in my stomach, in a good way! </p>

        <p>Have this as an appetizer to warm up for the main dish, or
            make a grilled cheese with some vegetarian sausage on the
            sandwhich for a tasty, well-rounded dinner.</p>
