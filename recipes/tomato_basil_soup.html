            <li>1 (28-ounce) canned plum tomatoes, with their juice</li>

            <li>1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves</li>
            <li>1 quart vegetable stock or water</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Toss together the
                tomatoes, 1/4 cup olive oil, salt, and pepper. Spread 
                the tomatoes in 1 layer on a baking sheet and roast for
                 45 minutes.</li>

            <li>In an 8-quart stockpot over medium heat, saute the onions
                 and garlic with 2 tablespoons of olive oil, the butter, 
                 and red pepper flakes for 10 minutes, until the onions 
                 start to brown. Add the canned tomatoes, basil, thyme, 
                 and chicken stock. Add the oven-roasted tomatoes, 
                 including the liquid on the baking sheet. Bring to a 
                 boil and simmer uncovered for 40 minutes. Pass through 
                 a food mill fitted with the coarsest blade. Taste for 
                 seasonings. Serve hot or cold.</li>
