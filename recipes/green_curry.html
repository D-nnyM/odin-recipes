        <h3>Spicy, super flavorful, tastes like a million bucks!</h3>

        <p>Lights fireworks filled with flavor in your mouth without
            the danger factor of actual fireworks! Wanting to try
            something new but aren't wanting to break the bank? Try
            this simple recipe.</p>

        <p>If the dish is too spicy, add a little more sugar to take 
            the bite away. Personally, I crave spicy things. It makes
            me feel alive.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <h1>For the crispy tofu:</h1>

        <ul>
            <li>1 14oz. block extra firm tofu</li>
            <li>1 tbsp low-sodium tamari</li>
            <li>2 tbsp nutritional yeast</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>For the green curry:</h1>

        <ul>
            <li>1 tbsp coconut oil</li>
            <li>4-5 tbsp green curry paste</li>
            <li>1 13.5oz can full-fat coconut milk</li>
            <li>1 tbsp coconut sugar</li>
            <li>3 cups mixed vegetables (such as peppers, pumpkin, bamboo
                shoots, and/or eggplant)</li>
            <li>Cooked rice, for serving</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425F. Cut the pressed tofu block in
                half lengthwise, then cut each rectangle into 16 even cubes.</li>
            <li>Add the cubed tofu to a large bowl. Pour the tamari over 
                the tofu, then use a spatula to gently toss until evenly 
                coated. Add in the nutritional yeast and repeat.</li>
            <li>Transfer the tofu to a baking sheet lined with a 
                silicone mat, leaving space between each piece. Bake on 
                the top rack of the oven for 20 minutes, then carefully 
                flip and bake for another 20-25 minutes. In the meantime, 
                prepare the green curry.</li>
            <li>Bring a nonstick pan to medium heat and add the coconut 
                oil. Once melted, add in the green curry paste; fry the 
                paste for 90 seconds, to bring out the flavors.</li>
            <li>Add the coconut milk and coconut sugar to the pan and 
                mix until well combined. Add in the mixed vegetables, 
                stir well, and bring the heat to high. Once the mixture 
                starts to bubble, reduce the heat to medium-low and let 
                simmer, covered, for 15-17 minutes, until the vegetables 
                are tender.</li>
            <li>Place some cooked rice into each serving bowl, then top 
                with green curry and crispy tofu. Serve warm.</li>
        </ol>
