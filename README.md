A recipe website!

Since I have completed the basic website, I thought it would be nice to
document what I have learned.

I have learned and practiced how to create different pages, link to each,
add unordered/ordered lists, paragraphs and images to pages, as well as
provide alternate text for visually impaired persons on images. I also
learned how to resize images for display and practiced my git workflow.

Great job!!!!
